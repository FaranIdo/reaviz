## About
REAVIZ is a modular chart component library that leverages React natively for rendering the components while
using D3js under the hood for calculations. The library provides an easy way to get started creating
charts without sacrificing customization ability.

## Why

Why another charting library? There are some really good ones out there like...

- [Victory](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/)
- [vx](https://vx-demo.now.sh/gallery)
- [nivo](https://nivo.rocks/)
- [react-vis](https://github.com/uber/react-vis)
- [semiotic](https://github.com/nteract/semiotic)
- [data-ui](https://github.com/williaster/data-ui)

As we tried out various different frameworks, each of them were missing one
thing or another that made them the PERFECT solution for us. Whether it was
a missing chart type or the way it was animated and so on. Mixing and matching
components from different frameworks to try and get that sweet spot will end up
in a hodge-podge solution with things working differently.

And thats how it started... As we built out these components we wanted to keep
a few basic principles:

- Provide complete customization
- Ensure the integrity of data and interpretation
- Ability to handle very large numbers and data sets
- Make sure it is aesthetically appealing

We hope you enjoy our work!
